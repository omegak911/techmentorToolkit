PURPOSE: to create one app for various teaching tools, seperated by React router

Apps
- Fate: to help pick students randomly during lectures
- ColdCallerAssistant: grab student name and image url from github using github handles
- TA Questionnaire: Common Q&A with search option
- TM Mock interview helpers/questions
  - name + password + conditional rendering as security //we want multiple accounts and a master account
  - password would be in config
  - keep track of student progress (sessions, scale of how well they did + comments)
  - tracker to display students with associated ratings + averages
  - customize + save clickable questions to a specific student
    - exclude questions they have already done
    - save for specific session //that way we can plan ahead
  - add student
  - add questions/category
  - tech stack: MongoDB  

- randomPair Generator: as many sprints with unique pairs
  - currently a snippet, we can do better...maybe


Pending:
- TA Supplemental Questionnaire
  - Don'ts
    - Use resources like CodePen/Blogs even if the official docs or stackoverflow has a link to it
    - Ask any questions related to how you should build your function
    - Stay silent for hours trying to figure out what a prompt is asking
    - Ask for any hints on what will be on the TA.
      - Techstack reviewed during townhall is what you can expect
      - The TA is designed to make sure you're ready for the 2nd half.  Knowing what's on the TA will NOT get you prepared for that.  In fact, it will guarantee that you will NOT be ready.
  - Do's
    - Study from scratch db/server/frontend
    - Start getting used to using only allowed resources
    - There will be a list on the TA.  If it's not on the list, don't visit those sites
    - Know where a link will take you before you click on it
    - If you're not sure if it's a valid question, start with that then ask.
